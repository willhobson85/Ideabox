## Introduction

 - In this project, we’ll be building an application that records and archives our ideas (good and bad alike).

 - Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we’ll rely on JavaScript to implement snappy filtering in the browser.

## Technologies

  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Features
  - Create a new card to add to the array.
  - Toggle the idea to be a favorite by clicking the star.
  - Remove an idea from the array by clicking the X.
  - You cannot add a new card without title and body text.

## What I Learned
  - I learned a lot about using Flexbox in the console to change the size of and orientation of our elements.
  - We worked as a team to make the html more dynamic.
  - We used paired and group programming to implement functionality.
  - The team made use of multiple class interactions and event bubbling through creative use of event listeners.
